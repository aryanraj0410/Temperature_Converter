# Temperature_Converter
I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed Task 2 of my internship at Bharat Intern! 🌡️
During this phase, I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project - a Temperature Converter App! This app can easily convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, making it incredibly useful for everyday life. But that's not all. We've added a fun twist to it! 🌞❄️
The app doesn't stop at conversions; it also knows how to set the mood. If the temperature is above 0°C, it will display a hot and sunny image, reminding us to embrace the warmth. If the temperature dips below 0°C, it switches to a cool and chilly image, perfect for staying cozy. 🔥❄️
